**HTML Studio**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**HTML Studio** is an online compiler that acurrately compiles HTML code into previews of web
pages. You can use it to edit your code and see the changes as they will appear to other users
after a single click.

Thanks to CodeMirror integration, your HTML code will have syntax highlighting applied by
default while using HTML Studio.
